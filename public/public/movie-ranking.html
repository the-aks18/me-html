 <h1>Best Movies and Anime according to AKS</h1>
 <h2>Hello Everyone! Here are my top recommendations</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Anime: Devilman  Crybaby</h3>
 <p>This is not a usual anime that we think of. It will make you rethink about everything in this world. It is dark, gore, but believe me, you will be amazed, dishearten and think about it again and again.
    Officialy available on netflix.
 </p>

 <h3>Movie: Your Name (Anime Movie)</h3>
 <p>After watching my first recommendation, you definitely will be wanting to watch something nice and warming. And in my opinion, nothing do it best than "Your Name".
    It is a rom-com movie which will fill you up with joy and mystery. But in the end, you will feel a warmth in your heart. </p>
